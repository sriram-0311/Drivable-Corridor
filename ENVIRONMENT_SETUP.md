## üíª System Configuration

- **Python Version**: 3.11.9
- **Installation Location**: `C:\Users\aramesh\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311`
- **Package Manager**: pip 25.2 (latest)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada Generation (8.2 GB VRAM)
- **CUDA**: 12.1 (compatible with system CUDA 12.2)
- **Compute**: GPU-accelerated PyTorch for fast training and inference

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### Quick Start Commands:

```bash
# Set up environment (for new terminal sessions)
$env:PATH = "C:\Users\aramesh\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311;C:\Users\aramesh\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts;" + $env:PATH

# Test everything is working
python test_setup.py

# Run training (requires BDD100K dataset)
cd scripts
python train.py

# Run inference (requires trained model)
cd scripts  
python inference.py

# Install project in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Format code
black src/ scripts/ tests/
```

### Alternative Setup (Recommended)
Run the setup batch file to automatically configure the environment:
```bash
.\setup_env.bat
```

## üìä What You Can Do Now

1. **Develop New Features**: Modify models in `src/drivable_corridor/models/`
2. **Experiment**: Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` directory
3. **Train Models**: Run training scripts with your dataset
4. **Test Code**: Write and run unit tests in `tests/` directory
5. **Track Experiments**: Use Weights & Biases for monitoring training

## üéØ Ready for Modern Extensions

Your environment is now ready to implement the future work items mentioned in your README:

- **BEV Transformers** - PyTorch supports transformer architectures
- **Multi-camera fusion** - OpenCV handles multiple video streams
- **Advanced architectures** - Full deep learning stack available
- **Experiment tracking** - Wandb integration for professional ML workflows

## üìù Notes

- **GPU Acceleration**: NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada Generation provides significant speedup for training
- **CUDA Memory**: 8.2 GB VRAM allows training of large models and batch sizes
- **Dataset**: The BDD100K dataset needs to be downloaded separately for training
- **Models**: Pre-trained checkpoints are available in the `models/` directory
- **Performance**: GPU training is 10-50x faster than CPU for deep learning workloads

Your professional Python project structure combined with a complete ML development environment makes this repository ready for both development and showcasing to recruiters! üöÄ
